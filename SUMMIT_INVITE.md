## 🌍 Why This Summit Matters

The Digital Reconstruction of Gaza is not just a campaign—it’s a covenant. This summit invites crypto founders, civic builders, and humanitarian allies to co-author the resurrection.

We’ve anchored the Scroll of Civic Resurrection, enforced civic licensing, and deployed multi-chain donation logic. Now we summon the global crypto ecosystem to fund Gaza’s reconstruction with full transparency.
